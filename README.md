# Blogv1
<br />
Update v2.1<br />
Major Bug fix<br />
It was crashing when Capital letters or more than a word was made the post title. <br />
Now it is fixed using Lodash.
<br />

-------------------
Updated to v2.0 <br />
Now it is linked with Mongo Atlas, and using mongoose now the posts are stored in databases. <br />
Earlier it was using arrays to store the posts.<br />
You can delete the post using the button in the page ```/posts/xyz``` or visit it by clicking "read more" beside the substring. <br />
The deployment link is down. <br />

-------------------
Simple blog site v1.0 <br />
run npm install to install the necessary packages <br />
Node app.js will start the server at Port 3000. <br />
<br /> <br />
This Site is also deployed at https://guarded-crag-72262.herokuapp.com/
<br /> <br /> 
You can visit "/compose" to create new posts
 <br /> <br /> 
If server is restarted the new posts are deleted but this will soon be updated using MongoDB with Mongoose so that even after restarting the server, the posts are saved.
